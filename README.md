# The-Interferon-Gene-IFITM3-and-the-Flu-Virus
### This repository is about performing an repeated measure analyses on the Interferon gene (IFITM3).The study consisted of about 17 to 20 healthy adults. Observations were recorded at a baseline value for all subjects (hour 0), then all the subjects were given the flu virus.  Then more observations were taken at additional time points hour 5, hour 12, etc.  At the end of the study, each subject was identified as being symptomatic (showing symptoms) versus asymptomatic (not showing symptoms).  So, we have two key variables time-point and symptomatic/asymptomatic groups.  The researcher would like to know the following questions:

### 1.	Are there any differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups?   
### 2.	Does it depend on what time point you look at?  
### 3.	Within each of the two groups, are there any changes over time compared to the baseline?  
### 4.	Does age/gender have any role in how the data behaves over time?
